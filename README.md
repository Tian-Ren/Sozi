Building and installing Sozi from sources
=========================================

Get the source files
--------------------

Clone the repository:

    git clone git://github.com/senshu/Sozi.git

test

Install the build tools and dependencies
----------------------------------------

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) CLI.
Sozi is known to work with Node.js 8 from [Nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).
If you plan to build a Windows executable from Linux or OS X, also install *wine*.
In Debian/Ubuntu and their derivatives, you can type the following commands.

    sudo apt install nodejs wine
    sudo npm install grunt-cli -g

If you plan to build Debian packages, also install the following packages:

    sudo apt install devscripts debhelper

From the root of the source tree:

    npm install

Also install the following:

* [Droid Sans](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Droid-Sans) as `vendor/DroidSans/DroidSans.eot|ttf` and `vendor/DroidSans/DroidSans-Bold.eot|ttf`

Build
-----

To build the desktop application for all platforms, run the following command from the root of the source tree:

    grunt

After a successful build, you will get a `dist` folder that will contain the
generated application bundles for each platform.

You can customize the build by creating a custom configuration file.
See `config.default.json` and `config.linux-x64.json` for examples.
For instance, if you want to build 64-bit executables for OS X and Linux,
the configuration file (`config.linux-darwin-x64.json`) will look like this:

```json
{
    "platforms": [
        "darwin-x64",
        "linux-x64"
    ]
}
```

Then run Grunt with the `--config` option:

    grunt --config=config.linux-darwin-x64.json

Other Grunt tasks are available for developers:

| Command                           | Effect                                                                      |
|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grunt electron-bundle` (default) | Build the desktop application and create zip bundles for various platforms. |
| `grunt deb`                       | Build Debian packages.                                                      |
| `grunt electron-build`            | Build the desktop application without creating bundles.                     |
| `grunt web-build`                 | Build the web application without uploading it.                             |
| `grunt web-demo`                  | Build the web application and upload it to a server.                        |
| `grunt pot`                       | Extract a template file (`locales/messages.pot`) for translation.           |


Install
-------

Since Sozi 18.01, a Debian package is available for users of Debian or Ubuntu-based distributions.

```
sudo dpkg -i sozi_[...].deb
```

For other platforms, Sozi is released as a zip/tgz archive that you can extract wherever you like.

* OS X users can drag the `Sozi.app` subfolder into their `Applications` folder.
* Windows and Linux users can run the `Sozi` executable directly from the extracted folder.

If installation on your specific platform is supported by Sozi, there will be an *install* folder in the extracted archive containing installation scripts.
To install Sozi system-wide:

```
cd Sozi-[...]/install
sudo ./install.sh
```

To install Sozi in your home folder:

```
cd Sozi-[...]/install
./install-local.sh
```

In many situations, Sozi will not need additional software to be installed.
